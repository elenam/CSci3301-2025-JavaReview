		/****Lab Task 1: answer the following questions ********/
		
		// Q1: Which of the following is a valid statement? Why?
		// Point p3 = new ColorPoint(3, 3, "maroon");
		// ColorPoint cp3 = new Point(3,3);
		
		// Q2: Uncomment a valid statement above. How can you call 
		// getColor() on the resulting variable? 
		
		// Clearly explain what is required from the type safety standpoint
		// to call this method. 
		// Hint: use typecasting.Â 
		
		// Once you get the method to work, print out the result of getColor()
		
		// Q3: see ColorPoint class. 
		
		// Q4: create an array list of points. Then add 10 points to it,
		// randomly choosing between regular points and color points. 
		// Generate the objects as follows:
		// Each object has a 50% chance to be a Point or a ColorPoint
		// Both x and y coordinates are random ints between -10 and 10 inclusive
		// The color for a ColorPoint is randomly chosen among at least two colors. 
		
		// Extra credit: Generate random colors that have an equal chance to 
		// take any value in the enum, regardless of how many there are 
		// in the enum.
		
		
		// Q5: write a loop to go through the array list that you generate 
		// in Q4 to do count how many blue (or any color of your choice) color points
		// there are. 
		// Print out the count after the loop.
		// Hint: use instanceof
